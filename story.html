      When we were analyzing datasets, we were intrigued with the mobile phone service usage and the amount of money people pay toward this service. This became a point of discussion because the internet service was bad in India and we were thinking about the days when the text service was such a prominent way. Compared to the average income, the proportion of money spent for usage seemed excessive. I later came to understand that the country's telecom industry was part of a larger monopoly. The whole experience got me thinking about the rest of the world. I wondered how many other places there were where the ordinary person could not afford mobile usage. 
  The idea for this data visualization came from personal experience while living abroad in Mexico. During that time I saw how expensive it was for ordinary people to afford mobile phone usage. Many people could not afford to buy usage in bulk, and ended up paying more per minute by purchasing usage in smaller increments. Because of this, text messaging was predominant. People without talk time would make calls and immediately hang up (you missed my call so now you have to call me back). Compared to the average income, the proportion of money spent for usage seemed excessive. I later came to understand that the country's telecom industry was part of a larger monopoly. The whole experience got me thinking about the rest of the world. I wondered how many other places there were where the ordinary person could not afford mobile usage.    
  This visualization is a choropleth map on a mercator projection of the globe. There are buttons on the top right enable you to color the choropleth by different combinations of plan size and cost. There are 2 plan sizes, less than 1GB and greater than or equal to 1GB. The cost can be viewed as either an average cost per gigabyte in USD, or as a relative cost. The relative cost is based upon the average income for that country assuming typical mobile usage. Typical mobile usage is assumed to be approximately 2GB per month based on anecdotal information and undocumented sources on the internet.
