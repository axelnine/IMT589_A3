      <p id="citation">&nbsp;&nbsp;Why this dataset? <br><br><br>
        
      
      
When we were analysing datasets, we were intrigued with the mobile phone service usage and the amount of money people pay toward this service. This became a point of discussion &nbsp;&nbsp; because the internet service was bad in India and we were thinking about the days when the text service was such a prominent way. Compared to the average income,&nbsp;&nbsp; the proportion of money spent for usage seemed excessive. The country's telecom industry was part of a larger monopoly and we wanted to delve more into it. 
<br>
We used the &nbsp;&nbsp;Google’s Telecom dataset and combined it with the GNI per capita data from the World Bank. Through my exploration I found that many developing countries had mobile data rates that were extremely high for the average person
<br>
The visualisation is a map projection of the globe. There are buttons on the top right enable you to color the map by different combinations of plan size and cost. There are 2 plan sizes, less than 1GB and greater than or equal to 1GB. The relative cost is based upon the average income for that country assuming typical mobile usage. On hover, the country highlights with a black border. We kept the transition simplistic and didn’t want to shadow the information. 
<br>
        We had a great help from <a href="https://github.com/winkelman">Winkelman’s Github</a> and we would like to give due credits for the idea.
